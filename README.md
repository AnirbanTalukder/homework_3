# Homework 3

This is the 3rd homework for the coding bootcamp, where I was asked to write codes to generate random password based on users input.
Based on users input, a password will be generated. User is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria, if those selections included user can I choose the length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. User will be askewd to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters and based on answering each prompt the password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

The codes are linked with the index.html which will render the js and generate the password
